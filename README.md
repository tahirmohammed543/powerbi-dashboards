# 📊 Data Analytics & Power BI Portfolio  
**Author:** Mohammed Tahir  

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio.  
This repository showcases **end-to-end Power BI dashboards** designed with a strong emphasis on **business decision-making, KPI clarity, and analytical depth** — not just visuals.

Each project represents a **real-world business scenario**, answering three critical questions:
- What business problem is being solved?
- Who is the dashboard built for?
- What decisions does it enable?
